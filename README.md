# UnityWebcamPhotobooth
A quick test I made to take webcam pictures in Unity.

**Steps:**
- Load up the scene
- Connect a webcam.
- Run the game and press "Picturify Me"
- Picture saved to "Screenshot.png" in the assets folder.
- Change the size of the "Screenshot" render texture to change the size of the output PNG.

This is currently just a test so everything's hardcoded and bad. Enjoy!
